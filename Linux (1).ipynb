In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn’t function.\n","\n","2.What is the difference between Hard Link & Soft Link ?\n","\n","   -  let's explore their key differences:\n","\n","    **Referencing**: A hard link points directly to the file content, whereas a soft link refers to the file name.\n","\n","    **Inode Numbers**: Hard links share the same inode number as the original file. In contrast, soft links have a unique inode number.\n","\n","    **Linking Across Different File Systems**: Hard links cannot span different file systems. On the other hand, soft links can link files across different file systems.\n","\n","    **Source File Deletion:** If you delete the source file, the hard link still accesses the content because it points to the data. However, if you remove the source file, the soft link breaks because it points to the file name, not the content.  \n","\n","3.What is a Kernel in Linux?\n","\n","   - The Linux kernel is the main component of a Linux operating system (OS) and is the core interface between a computer’s hardware and its processes. It communicates between the 2, managing resources as efficiently as possible.\n","\n","   The kernel is so named because—like a seed inside a hard shell—it exists within the OS and controls all the major functions of the hardware, whether it’s a phone, laptop, server, or any other kind of computer.\n","\n","4.How do you create a user account ?\n","\n","   - To create a user account in Linux, you can use the useradd or adduser\n","      command. Both methods require administrator privileges.\n","    \n","   - To create a new user on Linux in interactive mode, you can use the  \n","      adduser  command as follows:\n","        - sudo adduser username\n","\n","   - To create a new user in non-interactive mode, which is usually more\n","     suitable for scripting purposes, you can use the useradd  command as follows:\n","        - sudo useradd username\n","       \n","\n","5.What is the ‘grep’ command used for in Linux?\n","\n","   - The grep (global regular expression print) command is a tool in Linux and Unix that helps you search for specific text within files.\n","\n","6.Step1: Create user p1\n","\n"," Step2: He should be part of 3 groups g1,g2,g3.\n","\n"," Step3: whenever he creates a file automatically in the group section of file grp g1 should come.\n","\n","    -  To achieve all 3 steps in Linux use this commands:\n","       - Step 1.)  Create user p1 using ---> sudo useradd -m p1.\n","       - Step 2: Add user p1 to groups g1, g2, g3.\n","       - First, create the groups if they don’t already exist:\n","\n","              sudo groupadd g1\n","              sudo groupadd g2\n","              sudo groupadd g3\n","              \n","      - Now, add p1 to all three groups:  \n","\n","             sudo usermod -aG g1,g2,g3 p1    \n","             groups p1\n","\n","      - Step 3: Ensure default group for files is g1\n","        By default, new files created by a user get the user’s primary group.\n","        So, we make g1 the primary group of p1:  \n","\n","             sudo usermod -g g1 p1     \n","\n","7.Step1: Create directory /tmp/bg as root user and create files inside it.\n","\n","   Step2: “abhi” should be the owner of the directory. He should be able to create files and delete files inside the directory and also he should be able to add content to all files inside the directory.\n","\n","   - Step 1: Create /tmp/bg as root and create files\n","   Run the following commands as root (you may need sudo):\n","     - sudo mkdir -p /tmp/bg\n","     - sudo touch /tmp/bg/file1 /tmp/bg/file2\n","\n","   - Step 2: Change ownership to user abhi\n","       - sudo useradd -m abhi\n","       - sudo chown -R abhi:abhi /tmp/bg\n","\n","   -  Step 3: Give abhi full permissions\n","      - sudo chmod -R u+rwx /tmp/bg    \n","\n","\n","8.You suspect that a particular process is consuming excessive CPU resources  \n","   on your Linux server. How would you identify and terminate this process?   \n","\n","   - Two Methods are used to terminate the process:-\n","   -  First Method\n","     - Open Terminal ,Type top command and press enter\n","     - Press P (capital P) to sort by CPU usage.\n","     - Look at the PID of the top CPU-consuming process.\n","     - Type this Command sudo kill PID to kill the process.\n","   - Second Method\n","      - Open Terminal ,Type htop command and press enter\n","     - Sort by CPU (use F6 key to sort).\n","     - Look at the PID of the top CPU-consuming process.\n","     - Use arrow keys to highlight the process.\n","     - Press F9 to kill.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"qnYlp19e_mHV"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"OaHYIAep_I2P"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}]}
